# Trends in Irish hospital waiting list figures
[Required R packages](helpers/load_libs.R)

## Abstract
Waiting lists for procedures in Irish public hospitals are some of the longest in Europe. The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is the organisation responsible with collecting data about patients on these lists.  This project uses the NTPF data to examine the question of what trends are present within it and determine what similarities or differences exist between those trends. To answer this research questionthe Mann-Kendall and Senâ€™s slope statistical tests are applied to the data to verify if trends exist and the magnitude of those trends respectively.

The results returned from applying these tests show that, with the exception of the group containing all patents waiting under a year for a procedure, increasing trends are the norm. This result confirms that serious issues with the operation of the Irish health system need to be addressed and further research could build on what is presented here to investigate the problems in finer detail.
